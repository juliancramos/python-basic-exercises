# Python Practice Exercises

**Author:** Julián Ramos  

## Description  
This repository contains a collection of Python practice exercises covering fundamental concepts.  
The exercises were originally provided as separate notebooks (`.ipynb`) and have been reformatted to a clean structure, with each exercise in its own cell.  


## Covered Topics  
The exercises span the following topics:  

1. **Strings** – concatenation, slicing, indexing, case conversion, escaping characters, `.find()`, `.replace()`.  
2. **Tuples** – creation, indexing, slicing, concatenation, nested tuples, and functions like `len()` and `sorted()`.  
3. **Lists** – creation, indexing, slicing, concatenation, modification, deletion, sorting, and nested list access.  
4. **Sets** – removing duplicates, set operations (`union`, `intersection`, `difference`), and subset/superset checks.  
5. **Dictionaries** – creating dictionaries, accessing values by key, and retrieving keys and values.  
6. **Conditionals** – `if`, `if-else`, logical operators (`and`, `or`).  
7. **Loops** – `for` and `while` loops, iterating over ranges and collections, breaking conditions, and filtering values.  
8. **Functions** – defining and calling functions, handling multiple data types, concatenation behavior with `+`.  
9. **Classes** – defining classes, creating objects, using methods and attributes.  
10. **Extra Practice (Bonus)** – logical exercises.

## Format  
Each notebook follows the same structure:  
- **Header** with author, topic, and brief description.  
- **One exercise per code cell**, starting with a comment describing the task.  
- **Solution code** 

## Goal  
The goal of this work was to solve all exercises while keeping the notebooks clean, readable, and easy to understand.  
Additionally, the objective was to learn all the covered concepts and improve overall Python programming skills.
